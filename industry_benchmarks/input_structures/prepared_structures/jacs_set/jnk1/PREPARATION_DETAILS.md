1. Protein structure was prepared with Schrodinger Protein preparation Wizard (turned on capping
of termini)
2.The structure did not contain any cofactors and no non natural amino acids were found,
therefore no modifications.
2. Ligands were left unchanged, no protonation or conformational states were detected.
3. tested successfully reading in ligands with gufe as 'SmallMoleculeComponents' and protein as
'ProteinComponent'
