1. Protein structure was prepared with Schrodinger Protein preparation Wizard (turned on capping
of termini). Afterward NMA cappings were converted to NME.
2.The structure did not contain any cofactors and no non-natural amino acids were found,
therefore no modifications. 
2. Ligands were left unchanged, no conformational states were detected, but protonations changes 
where found and kept, as this is a charge anihilation test set. 
3. tested successfully reading in ligands with gufe as 'SmallMoleculeComponents' and protein as
'ProteinComponent'
