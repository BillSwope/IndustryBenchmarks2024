1. Protein structure was prepared with Schrodinger Protein preparation Wizard (turned on capping
of termini). Afterward NMA cappings were converted to NME.
2.The structure did not contain any cofactors, the ions were renamed from X1 -> Ca, and no non
natural amino acids were found.
2. Ligands were left unchanged, no protonation or conformational states were detected.
3. tested successfully reading in ligands with gufe as 'SmallMoleculeComponents' and protein as
'ProteinComponent'
